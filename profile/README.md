# Ennui Made Mods Once

This is the storage place of my Minecraft modding career, spanning from 2019 to 2023.

All the six active mods are now maintained by @UpcraftLP and are held by the [Up's Minecraft Mods](https://github.com/Up-Mods) GitHub organization.

## The Roadmap to Retire

### All

- [x] Give all mods new banners
    - The Ok Zoomer one looks pretty ugly by (my) today's standards
- [x] Quit modding

### Ok Zoomer

- [x] Publish preliminary progress on a new config screen
- [x] Update to Quilt Config's new API
- [x] Remove all Quilt migration warnings on the mod and its pages
    - They did its job in the end; I wish I did more though
- [x] Use the built-in MixinExtras for savings
- [ ] Port to Minecraft 1.20.2
    - Relying on SpruceUI was a mistake
    - Getting rid of the Fabric API dependency on LibZoomer, however, was good for 1.20.2 porting!

### Crooked Crooks

- [x] Update to Minecraft 1.20.1 with @UpcraftLP's help

### Boring Series:

- [x] Link together the mod pages as a consistent series
    - Damage Incorporated was supposed to be renamed to "Boring Environmental Damage Control" (Boring EDC) but that never will happen
    - The Boring Guy was supposed to be replaced by a grayscale version of my persona; that will unfortunately never happen either

#### Boring Backgrounds

- [x] Update to Minecraft 1.20.1

#### Boring Default Game Rules

- [x] Fix license

#### Damage Incorporated

- [x] Fix license
