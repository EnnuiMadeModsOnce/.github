# Ennui Made Mods Once

This is the storage place of my Minecraft modding career, spanning from 2019 to 2023.

This career, however, isn't over yet, at least not until the roadmap is complete and until all potential little issues are ironed out.

## The Roadmap

### Ok Zoomer

- [x] Publish preliminary progress on a new config screen
- [x] Update to Quilt Config's new API
- [x] Remove all Quilt migration warnings on the mod and its pages
    - They did its job in the end; I wish I did more though
- [ ] Port to Minecraft 1.20.2
    - Relying on SpruceUI was a mistake

### Crooked Crooks

- [ ] Update to Minecraft 1.20.1 with @UpcraftLP's help
- [ ] Update to Minecraft 1.20.2...?

### Boring Series:

- [ ] Link together the mod pages as a consistent series
    - Damage Incorporated was supposed to be renamed to "Boring Environmental Damage Control" (Boring EDC) but that never will happen
    - The Boring Guy was supposed to be replaced by a grayscale version of my persona; that will unfortunately never happen either

#### Boring Backgrounds

- [x] Update to Minecraft 1.20.1
- [ ] Update to Minecraft 1.20.2 if needed

#### Boring Default Game Rules

- [ ] Update to Minecraft 1.20.2 if needed

#### Damage Incorporated

- [ ] Update to Minecraft 1.20.2
